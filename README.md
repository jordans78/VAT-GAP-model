# VAT-GAP-model

This VAT Gap model is based mainly on data from SUT tables and can estimate policy options that the country may consider in the future, such as:

- Changing VAT rates (standard, reduced, exemptions);
- Estimation of tax expenditures;
- Redistributive effects of taxation on households;
- Estimation of effective tax rates etc.


Some of the simulation results based on dummy data are available below
